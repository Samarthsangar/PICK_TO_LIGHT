# PICK_TO_LIGHT
Pick To Light software solutions is a system designed to streamline and automate warehouse or shop floor operations. Automation is mainly done for picking operations thereby increasing efficiency, productivity and picking accuracy. It primarily uses alphanumeric displays and buttons at storage locations, to guide the shop floor operator in light-aided manual picking, putting, sorting, and assembling of various components. 
Let us consider a vehicle manufacturing shop floor. The shop floor worker has to select between two parts, say X and Y, available in two different bins. There is a dependency on the shop floor worker to choose between X and Y. In case he gets his choice wrong it may result in a wrong action down the line. The Pick to light system comes into picture here where the shop floor worker doesnâ€™t have to make a decision, instead he just follows the light picking parts as they are indicated. Here is how a typical flow would look like. 
In order to implement it using a PIC based micro-controller, following things are required: 
We have to know this in order to light the correct parts bin for next item
All parts need to be sorted out in bins
Light above each bin need to glow when that part is to be used
After picking the shop floor worker will press a say a switch to confirm the pick 
Move on to next pick and repeat 
Instead of implementing the whole system, the aim of the project is to implement the client which is nothing but a PIC micro-controller in our case.
